Dino _was_ a monorepo started in late 2022 to learning Godot, do game
jams, and start some addons/libraries. Since late 2023, I've been reimagining
and refactoring - the games have being deconstructed and DRYed up into
shared systems.

Dino now presents a suite of short games - these are largely platformer and
top-down games with dungeon crawler and metroidvania-style maps. The
maps are procedurally generated with basic algorithms and some parsed
plaintext - I hope to put together some video devlogs covering the code soon.

I'm currently pushing for a June 1st release [on
steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2589550/Dino/)! Wishlist it today, or
just get the [latest on itch.io](https://russmatney.itch.io/dino).

Feel free to ping me [on Discord](https://discord.gg/xZHWtGfAvF) with any
questions or feedback!
