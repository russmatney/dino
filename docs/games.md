Dino Games
==========

Dino was originally intended as a monorepo full of independent games - a
jumpstarter for doing game jams. I was experimenting! Along the way I wasn't
sure if it would make sense to persue a more serious game alongside the others,
or if the addons would be consumable from another repo.

At this point I want to shake things up - I'm trying to hone in on some reusable
controllers and game designs, and see if I can refactor all the pieces to fit
together.

Anyway, for posterity, here's the old games documention!

# Void Spike:
Play the web version here: [russmatney.itch.io/spike](https://russmatney.itch.io/spike)

A submission for the GMTK Game Jam 2023
# Shirt:
Play the web version here: [russmatney.itch.io/shirt](https://russmatney.itch.io/shirt)

A submission for the [[https://itch.io/jam/godot-wild-jam-58][Godot Wild Jam #58]]
# Mountain:
A work-in-progress.
# Super Elevator Level:
Play the downloadable version here: [russmatney.itch.io/super-elevator-level](https://russmatney.itch.io/super-elevator-level)

Or the webversion: [russmatney.itch.io/super-elevator-level-web](https://russmatney.itch.io/super-elevator-level-web)

Submitted to the [[https://itch.io/jam/go-godot-jam-4][Go Godot Jam 4]]
# Herd: A sheep bullet hell
No separate itch page and build yet - but playable in Dino's main deploy:
[russmatney.itch.io/dino](https://russmatney.itch.io/dino).

I worked on this for the Bullet Hell Jam 2023, but didn't end up submitting -
it's still very prototypey.
# Mvania 19: HatBot
A submission for [[https://itch.io/jam/metroidvania-month-19][Metroidvania Month-long Jam 19]].

Play the downloadable version here: [russmatney.itch.io/mvania19](https://russmatney.itch.io/mvania19)

Or the webversion: [russmatney.itch.io/mvania19-web](https://russmatney.itch.io/mvania19)
# Tower
A Jetpack-fueled mess of propulsion in some generated tilemaps.

I built much of Reptile (a dino addon) while working on this game.

Play the deployed version here: [russmatney.itch.io/tower](https://russmatney.itch.io/tower)
# Cozy Gunner
A juicy gunner.

Play the deployed version here: [russmatney.itch.io/gunner](https://russmatney.itch.io/gunner)
# Harvey
An overcooked-like farming game. Submission for the Ludum Dare 52 (Theme: Harvest).

Play the deployed version here: [russmatney.itch.io/harvey](https://russmatney.itch.io/harvey)
# Ghost House
Play the deployed version here: [russmatney.itch.io/ghosts](https://russmatney.itch.io/ghosts)

A small something created for the [Godot Wild Jam #52](https://itch.io/jam/godot-wild-jam-52).
# Snake
A rough prototype for [Juice Jam 2](https://itch.io/jam/gdb-juice-jam-ii).

Play the deployed version here: [russmatney.itch.io/snake](https://russmatney.itch.io/snake)
# Runner
Play the deployed version here: [russmatney.itch.io/runner](https://russmatney.itch.io/runner)

A catch-the-leaf inspired running game.

The core of the logic is the Runner.gd script, which handles adding and removing
rooms while the player moves across them until they are all complete.
# Dungeon Crawler
Play the deployed version here: [russmatney.itch.io/dungeon-crawler](https://russmatney.itch.io/dungeon-crawler)

This was a chance to implement keys and door logic, and a basic boss state
machine. The map is one giant scene, and the tiles use auto-tiling, which should
make it simple to doodle a few more levels.
