name="bones"
description="
A set of static helpers and micro-addons used across games.

Features:

- Util.gd (aliased as `U`). A big gdscript-extras Util.gd file.
- Trolls.gd
- Navi.gd
- DJ.gd
- Reptile.gd - static tilemap helpers

- Machine.gd
- Actions - a data-driven interactions api

- Two starter cc0 fonts.

I'm hopeful that bones is a minimal and slimmed-down always-utils library for
the rest of my godot games.

Background:

I used Dino as a monorepo across a handful of game jams, and accumulated
a bunch of experiments and code: e.g. tilesets, starter sounds, and menu/ui helpers.
